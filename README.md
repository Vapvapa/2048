# 2048

![Game start](readme-resources/img1.png)

This project is a 2048 game.

You can move using the up, down, right and left buttons.

![Example](readme-resources/img2.png)

You need to connect the same numbers to get a larger number. The greater the sum of the numbers on the field, the greater the score. All the action takes place on a 4x4 field. The player controls the movement of numbers using swipes; with each new movement, a new digit appears on the field â€“ in 90% of cases it is 2, in the remaining 10% it is 4.

The game ends when all the fields or a step are filled, which should result in the number 2048.

The project uses the MVC software architectural pattern.

And it uses swing.
